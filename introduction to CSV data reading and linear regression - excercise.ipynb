    "## 4. Remarks:\n",
    "One non-obvious point at this point is that for the sake of simplicity, we have not spoken about data types. In this example, we used python lists and numpy arrays interchangeably. However, there are several very important differences that you should know about. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Python list: `some_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]`\n",
    "- good: can be defined without knowing how large it will be, i.e. values are simply appended by `some_list.append(some_value)`\n",
    "- bad: one cannot do math operations on them, i.e. `some_list * another_list` does not work\n",
    "\n",
    "##### numpy arrays: `some_nparray = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])`\n",
    "- good: can do math operations on them, i.e. elementwise multiplication `some_nparray * some_nparray` works.\n",
    "- good: higher dimensions, e.g. matrices, are possible and easy to handle\n",
    "- bad: appending values is not part of the idea\n",
    "- functions from numpy or scipy naturally return numpy arrays by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### recommendation:\n",
    "- use numpy arrays whenever possible. They can be initialized i.g. by `np.zeros(length)`.\n",
    "- if you don't know how, use a list and convert it into a numpy array by `np.array(some_list)`.\n",
    "- google is your friend\n",

    "## 5. DIY\n",
    "You might have noticed that this was only one file in a series of enzyme kinetics measurements. Load the other files and process them in a for loop in order to extract the starting velocities from each file. The list of volume concentrations (ordered as the input files) is given by (arbitrary units)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "vol_s = np.array([1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,7,7,7,9,9,9,11,11,11,13,13,13,15,15,15, \\\n",

    "After you have obtained the velocities, first check if the fits are okay. Then plot them as a function of the volume concentrations. (Extra task: If you still have time, extract the Michaelis-Menten constant from this.)\n",

    "#### Tips\n",
    "- file names are e.g. `data/0.txt`, ranging from 0 to 47 (which is contained in `range(48)`)\n",
    "- You might encounter the problem that the input data files have different lengths. Instead of terminating at a defined last line, check for the length of the line `len(line)` (have a look above how long the data containing lines should be).\n",
    "- with the given data set, it might be enough to use the first 5 data points for the linear fit of the maximum velocity...\n",
